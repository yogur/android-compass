A sample Android digital compass application that fuses accelerometer and magnetometer sensor data to obtain a tilt compensated heading. Moreover, a low-pass filter is used to obtain smoother sensor data, and magnetic declination is calculated to obtain true heading.

The following blog post discusses the sample application in detail: [Developing a Compass Android Application](https://talesofcode.com/developing-compass-android-application/)
